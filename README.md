# Bank-Churn-Analysis
Identify the reason of customers who are likely to churn in the future


•	Design machine learning models in Pandas Python to forecast customer churn and analyze critical factor

•	Explore and preprocess given labeled data with data cleaning, categorical feature encoding

•	Train supervised machine learning models on data with logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine

•	Do L1, L2 regularization on trained models with optimal parameters to prevent feature overfitting

• Evaluate model performance with 5-fold Cross-Validation and confusion matrix

•	Analyze the key factors from feature importance and evaluate model performance
